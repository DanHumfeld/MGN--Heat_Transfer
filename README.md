# MGN--Heat_Transfer
First attempt to make a Mesh Graph Network, inspired by Pfaff et al.

## Purpose
This is meant to be practice for a practitioner. 
This project will require learning many new things, and accomplishing something
that few have done successfully - implement a MeshGraphNet.

This MGN will be exclusively data-based. Future projects may seek to implement
a Physics-Informed MGN, and then to expand the field.
